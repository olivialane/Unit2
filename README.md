# Creative computing as a way of making the arts accessible üé®



### Is art REALLY for everyone?

Museum closures through lockdown prevented the public from developing a connection with the arts and culture, which despite technology, most galleries were not able to emulate.  During this time, I began to listen to podcasts. This online world created through audio allowed me to listen to views on arts and culture, alongside listening to readings of texts. **It broadened my scope of what art was.** It was The White Pube podcast that really changed my perspective of the art world. A [recent text](https://www.thewhitepube.co.uk/love-letter-to-the-art-world) written by Gabrielle De La Puente details how she feels that the art world leaves people who are house bound. 

> We are ships in the night and my ship has broken down. I am only new to this. There are millions of people housebound because of sickness and disability. And yes, I know every art organisation had a go at doing online exhibitions over the pandemic, but every single one of them was a lifeless mess so I cannot count them. I stay in my house, alive at night like an animal. Lonely, in pain, always tired. And I think okay, maybe art is not for everyone. Maybe I got that wrong.

### What was so wrong with the way that art galleries displayed art over lockdown? 

I experienced one virtual exhibition over lockdown. There was a reason why that number isn't higher. In my opinion, art that was made to be seen in person by the human eye just does not translate well to the virtual world. Art in the virtual realm should be tailored to the medium, rather than attempting to stuff Piccasso paintings into the virtual box via a video stream. For a community of inovators, our response to exhibiting art during a pandemic was dissappointing.

### What role does computing play in working towards a more accessible kind of art? üñ•

It is important to note that creating art that is accessible to everyone is very difficult to do, exclusitory factors can be found everywhere. However, in this instance of people who are not able to leave the house to see art, my response is to turn to the physical (as suggested in the text).
